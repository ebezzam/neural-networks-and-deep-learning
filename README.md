# Modified code samples from "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains modified code samples from Michael Nielen's book on
"Neural Networks and Deep Learning".

I've added my solutions to the following problems in his book:
* [Matrix-based approach](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html#problem_269962)
* [L1 regularization](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html#problems_201277)
* [Momentum-based gradient descent](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html#problem_713937)
